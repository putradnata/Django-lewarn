# Django-xixixi-laugh-abiez

This is just my first app using Django, no more no less.
- Will update frequently as soon as i've time

## What's Working:

What's now working in this project :

```bash
v.666
  * Homepage
  * Ticket Page
    The Template already with Inheritance xixixi  - feeling happy
  * I think just that for now, too tired to write this one, lol
```

## Usage

Just clone this repo and . . . 

Y'all already know right how to run the server. If no, just go to [Django Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial01/).
